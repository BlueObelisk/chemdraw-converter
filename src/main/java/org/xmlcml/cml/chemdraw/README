This distribution contains a library to read (and partially write)
Chemdraw (CDX) files into/from CMLDOM. It is based on the web-published
definition of CDX files on the cambridgesoft.com site and honours
many of the components of a CDX file. It does not support Chemdraw-specific
elements such as display types, fonts, etc.

The code is made available under the Artistic license, http://www.opensource.org
In general it may be freely distributed and modified, but the original authorship
must be honoured and modified versions must use different names.

The current distribution is a library, not an application and will require a 
CMLDOM for integration into a system. See http://www.xml-cml.org and
