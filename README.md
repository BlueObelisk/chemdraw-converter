# Chemdraw-Converter

This distribution contains a library to read (and partially write)
Chemdraw (CDX) files into/from CMLDOM. It is based on the web-published
definition of CDX files on the cambridgesoft.com site and honours
many of the components of a CDX file. It does not support Chemdraw-specific
elements such as display types, fonts, etc.

The current distribution is a library, not an application and will require a
CMLDOM for integration into a system. See http://www.xml-cml.org and
